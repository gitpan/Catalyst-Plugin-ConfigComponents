Name
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigComponents - Creates components from config
    entries

Version
    0.6.$Revision: 133 $

Synopsis
       # In your Catalyst application
       package YourApp;

       use Catalyst qw(ConfigComponents);

       __PACKAGE__->setup;

       # In your applications config file
       <component name="Model::YourModel">
          <parent_classes>YourExternal::ModelE<lt>/parent_classes>
          <parent_classes>Catalyst::ModelE<lt>/parent_classes>
       </component>

       # Do not create YourApp::Model::YourModel this module will do it for you

       # In a controller this will call your_method in
       # the class YourExternal::Model
       $result = $c->model( q(YourModel) )->your_method( ... );

Description
    When the application starts this module creates Catalyst component class
    definitions using config information. The defined class inherits from
    the list of parent classes referenced in the config file

Configuration and Environment
    Specify a *Plugin::ConfigComponents* config option. Attributes are

    *component_active*
       If the *component_active* config attribute exists and is false the
       component will not be loaded

    *parent_classes*
       List of classes for the derived component to inherit from

    *search_extra*
       To add additional search paths, specify a key named *search_extra* as
       an array reference. Items in the array beginning with :: will have
       the application class name prepended to them

    *setup_method*
       Defaults to "_setup_config_components", the method to call after the
       call to Catalyst::setup_components

    You may want to add the line:

       Class::C3::initialize();

    to your Catalyst application after the "__PACKAGE__->setup" call if the
    base class creates any "diamond" patterns in the inheritance tree

Subroutines/Methods
  setup_components
    Calls the setup method (which defaults to "setup_config_components")
    after the parent method

  _setup_config_components
    For each config key matching "\A Model|View|Controller ::" it checks if
    the corresponding component already exists, and if it doesn't this
    method creates it at run-time

    The parent class is set to "MyApp->config->{ $component
    }->{parent_classes}" if it exists, "Catalyst::$component" otherwise. The
    *parent_classes* can be an array ref in which case the defined class
    will inherit from all classes in the list (multiple inheritance)

    thought it would be better as a plugin and have extended it to handle MI
