Revision history for Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigComponents

0.6.133  2012-07-16
         - Catalyst 5.9.13 merged C::C::ActionRole into C::C and started
           producing warnings. Adding the _application attribute to the
           config shuts the fucker up

0.6.130  2012-07-15
         - Removed execute bit from Build.PL

0.6.127  2012-04-19

         - Updated to inc::Bob 1.3

0.5.125  2009-07-29

         - Change _load_component to _load_config_component to be more unique

         - Distro signed with new key

0.4.109  25/06/2009
         - Distro signing stopped. Module::Signature only looks at
           pgp.mit.edu and that fails to create the keyID correctly
         - Fixed back compat "base_class" bug

0.3.102  24/06/2009

         - Set "component_active" to false to stop component loading
         - Major refactor. No longer uses Module::Plugable::Object
         - Replaced "base_class" in favour of "parent_classes"
         - No longer use the "setup_components" config entry

         - Drop support for ::M ::V ::C namespaces

         - More CPAN testing stuff
         - Sorted use of C3

0.1.57   17/12/2008
         - Use "Plugin::ConfigComponents" as a config key in
           preference to "setup_compenents"
         - Commented out calls to C3 because they slow compilation
           down and don't seem to do anything
         - Added call to Class::C3::reinitialize if C3 is loaded

0.1.50   14/11/2008
         - Added BEGIN block in tests. This should work around vpit's
